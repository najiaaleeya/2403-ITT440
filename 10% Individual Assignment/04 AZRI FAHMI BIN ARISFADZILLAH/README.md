What is an IDE? IDE means Integrated Development Environment it is a comprehensive facility that is used for software development. 
IDE combines common developer tools to be all compiled together in a single (GUI) application. Key component of what should qualify an IDE is Source Code Editor, Local Build Automation, and a Debugger.<br /><br />

  * **Source Code Editor** is a text editor that assists in writing code in its development process, it often includes many quality-of-life (QOL) for the user as such syntax highlighting, bugs chechking for while code
      is being written.  
  * **Local Build Automations** are utilities that is used to automate simple, repeatable tasks as a part of creating software such as compiling source codes, running automated tests.

That is the requirement for an iDE. It brings such convenience to modern-day developers as it offers a simple and easy environment to develop their programs. Developers used to edit their code with a plain text editor, invoke the compiler, and edit or debug their programs from the operating system's command line.
