# TITLE : Server TCP Code Using Python (Socket Programming)
## What is Server?
* Server is a *computer program* or *equipment* that serves another program and its user. In other word, it is called as a client.
* In the client-server programming model, a server program *receives* requests from client programs and *responds* to them.

## What is TCP?
* TCP also known as *Transmission Control Protocol*.
* TCP located at the *Transport Layer* in the OSI Model.
* TCP also is a *communications standard* that allows computer application programs to communicate with one another computing devices over a network.
* TCP is designed to send the *packets* across networks and ensure the packets deliveries and arrivals successfulness.

## TCP Header
### Figure below shows TCP header format with the bits

## What is Socket Programming?
* Socket Programming is a *communication connection point* that user can be name and address in a network.
* The socket *API* (Application Programming Interface) are used to send messages through a network.
* An *easy-to-use* and *reliable* API for Python is available, and it maps straight to the system calls.

## Client-Server TCP.c Socket Programming in Python
### Diagram below shows how client-server TCP.c in Python works :

## Python Sockets
1. `socket()` = Creates a new socket.
2. `bind()` = Associates the socket to a specific address and port.
3. `listen()` = Starts listening for incoming connections on socket.
4. `connect()` = Establishes a connection to a remote server.
5. `accept()` = Accepts a connection from a client and returns a new socket for communication.
6. `send()` = Sends data through the socket.
7. `recv()` = Receives data from the socket.
8. `close()` = Closes the socket connection.

## Codes (Both client and server code are required to run this programme)
### Server Code
Based on the diagram below, the server bind the socket to port 27679, listen for incoming connection and send a message back when connection is initiated :-

### Client Code
Based on the diagram given, the client will create a socket and initiate a connection with the server and print out a response from the server :-
