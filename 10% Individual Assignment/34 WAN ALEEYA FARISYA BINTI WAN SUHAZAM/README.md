# **How to Write a Simple Shell Script**
## What is a Shell Script?
Shell scripting is the process of programming an operating system to perform particular actions based on a text file
containing a series of commands. These commands from the shell script are then interpreted, processed, and carried out via a
shell interface. Time can be saved and human error can be eliminated by automating repetitive tasks.
## What is the Purpose of a Shell Script?
The main purpose of shell scripting is to automate routine system operations including backing up files, monitoring system
resources, and managing user accounts. System administrators can improve accuracy, simplify complicated procedures, and save
time by turning a set of commands into a script.
## What is the Type of Shell?
There are five types of shells with different capabilities, so it is very important to choose the right type of shell that
works best for the intended application.
### 1. **Bourne Shell**
   The Bourne shell which is also known as `sh` was the original UNIX shell or command-line interpreter developed by Stephen
   Bourne at AT&T Bell Labs. Although it is known for its rapid operating speed, this type of shell has limited built-in
   functionality and is unable to reference the previous commands.

### 2. **C Shell**
   The C shell, also known as `csh` is a shell developed by Bill Joy at the University of California Berkeley. This shell
   uses a similar syntax as the C programming language and incorporates aliases into the available features.
### 3. **Korn Shell**
   The Korn shell, which is also known as `ksh` was written by David Korn at AT&T Labs in the 1980s. It combines the
   features of both Bourne and C shell, along with its improvements, such as string and array manipulation.
### 4. **Bourne Again Shell**
   It is also known as `bash` which is developed by Brian Fox. It is a combination of `sh`, `csh` and `ksh` capabilities.
   Bash shell is the most used shell in Linux system as it is the default shell on Linux and Mac OSX. This shell can
   recall the previous commands and edit them.
### 5. **Z Shell**
   Z shell, also known as `zsh`, was created by a student named Paul Festad at Princeton University in 1990. Z shell is an
   extended version of the earlier shells with additional features and capabilities including plugins and function indexes.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Shell Scripting
### Advantages
* Automates repetitive tasks and is able to boost productivity.
* Ideal for rapid prototype complex applications.
* Simple to create, modify and debug.
* Highly portable and capable of running on any UNIX-like system with minimal modification.

### Disadvantages
* May be slower than the programs written in compiled languages.
* Less suited for complex computational tasks.
* Scripting languages may be more prone to costly errors compared to other programming languages.
* Database tasks that require a high level of database access are not suitable for shell scripting.
